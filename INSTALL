VCP Developer System Installation Instructions
==============================================

These instructions are for developers only, not for end users.  End
users should use one of the pre-built distributions like "vcp.exe" or
"vcp-rh8", etc in order to get supported, stable builds.

Before installing VCP, you must install the XML Parsing library "Expat",
available at:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

Installing that allows XML::Parser to install, which allows
XML::ValidWriter to install, which allows VCP to install.

You will also need a p4d >= 99.2 if you want to use the p4 I/O features,
since vcp uses the filelog -m option.

VCP is all Perl code, and uses a number of other Perl modules.  Installing
these is a bit of a pain, but CPAN or PPM can do it for you.  See
Makefile.PL for what you need.

Note that there are a few "developer only" modules like BFD and
Text::Table that you may want to install manually if you want to use
some of the developer-only filters and destinations.
